## Communication & Collaboration Strategy
We use **GitHub** as our platform for code sharing and version control.  
All MATLAB scripts and analysis will be pushed to this repository, and each team member will pull the latest version before making changes.  
For discussions and meetings, we use **Teams** as our communication channel.  

### Workflow
1. Each member clones the repository.
2. Changes are committed and pushed to the `main` branch (or feature branches if needed).
3. Before pushing, everyone pulls the latest version to avoid conflicts.
4. Larger changes can be merged via Pull Requests for clarity.
5. Make changes
